# MIPS-Assembly-Language
Some small projects using MIPS assembly language, which runs on MARS 4.5.

The projects come from the online course "Computer Organization" on Coursera, which is from Peking University.

The first project is about the basic knowledge of input and output using MIPS. We input a char, and the program will decide whether it is a capital or a lower character, or a number, and transfer it to a certain string. Then print the string on the screen. The program will loop forever, until we input a question mark.

The second project is about the search of the certain character in a string. We input a string and a char, and the program will search in the string, whether the character is in it. Output the location of the character if it is found, or output the fail message if it is not found.
